### Extension Programs
1. Write the classic Fizz Buzz program. Loop from 1 to 100, and print "Fizz" is the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5 and "FizzBuzz" if it's divisible by 3 and 5, or just the number if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5.
2. Write a program that takes a number as its first `arg` and prints all its factors.
