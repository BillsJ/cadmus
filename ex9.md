```java
public class Ex9 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 5;
    double b = Math.pow(5, 2);
    System.out.println("5 to the power of 2 is " + b);

    int c = 5.5;
    double d = Math.pow(5.5, 2);
    System.out.println("5.5 to the power of 2 is " + d);

    int e = 10;
    int f = (int) Math.pow(5, 2);
    System.out.println("5 to the power of 2 is " + f);

    int l = 4;
    double sqrt = Math.sqrt(4);
    System.out.println("The square root of 4 is " + sqrt);

    int m = 5;
    sqrt = Math.sqrt(5);
    System.out.println("The square root of 5 is " + sqrt);
  }

### Extension Programs
1. Given that momentum = mass * (velocity to the power of 2), write a program to calculate momentum given mass and velocity.
2. Write a program to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index) using the formula, BMI = Mass / (Height to the power of 2)
